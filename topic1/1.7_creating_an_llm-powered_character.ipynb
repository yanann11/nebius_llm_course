Cut off, Londoners developed extraordinary powers: wielding fire, speaking with animals, glimpsing the future, or the charmingly useless talent of making flowers bloom in winter. The King became the realm's greatest sorcerer. But magic brought danger too. Mythical beasts and fey creatures emerged, transforming the city into a perilous wilderness. Londoners, more familiar with foxes (or machete-wielding burglars) than griffins, were thrust into a dangerous world without the comforts of mobile phones, or the internet, or chatgpt. The seemingly endless supply of food from other countries was also cut short. Their survival now depended on their newfound abilities and the fading memory of a lost world.\n",

        "Two years after the arcane storms, Greater London has transformed from a concrete metropolis into a magical wilderness dotted with interconnected villages. Nature has aggressively reclaimed the urban landscape, with parks becoming forests, streets overrun with plant life, and magical energies subtly altering familiar landmarks. Londoners have adapted by building magical architecture, incorporating enchantments into their homes and creating localized power hubs around areas of strong magical resonance. Navigation and daily life are now intertwined with the rhythms of this new magical ecosystem.\n",

        "The populace has developed diverse magical abilities, ranging from subtle everyday talents to powerful specialized skills. Society is evolving around these abilities, creating new roles and fostering a sense of community and interdependence. The King and his council of mages lead the way, focused on understanding and navigating this changed world. While dangers from mythical beasts and fey creatures are ever-present, Londoners are becoming resourceful, learning to coexist with the magical environment and rediscover simple joys.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the challenges, the overarching tone is optimistic. Without the distractions of technology, communities are stronger, and a sense of wonder permeates daily life. The focus is on local production, barter, and the resourceful use of both salvaged remnants of the old world and the bounty of the new magical one. Greater London is not a dystopia, but a weird and dangerous place where resilience, adaptation, and the allure of the unknown drive its inhabitants forward into an extraordinary, if unpredictable, future.\n",

        "## Task 2. Creating a chat bot arena\n",
        "\n",
        "In this task, you'll create a `ChatArena` class that will host conversations between two characters. Having a Chat Arena is a great way of exploring NPC behavior without having to carry on the conversations manually. For example, we'll be using it for character evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since NPC Factory works with user-NPC interactions, you'll have to register both NPCs as users inside the arena and call them by the generated `user_id`'s when it's their time to speak up as users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, you'll need to force start the conversation with some initial prompt of the first NPC. It can be `\"Hello! Who are you?\"` or something else depending on what you decide to evaluate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, you'll find examples showing the target interface of the Arena. Also we provide a skeleton of the class, if that can be of help. And, as always, if you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask LLMs for help! Just be sure to provide both the NPC Factory implementation and the examples below."
